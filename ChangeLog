 * it's now possible to send emails to interested users on those events:
   - start of observation (start of imaginign, e.g. after telescope
     slew)
   - end of observation (after last image taken)
   - first image with astrometry
   - when all images from observation group are processed
   - at the end of night observations
 * Users can be assigned either to observations, or to group of
   observations - e.g. you can get those emails for observation 1033 and
   for all GRBs (even new one, which will be generated from GRB). It's 
   configurable on user level.
